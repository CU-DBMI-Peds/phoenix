The Organ Dysfunction Scoring for the Phoenix Criteria. The Phoenix sepsis
criteria are based on the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which includes respiratory,
cardiovascular, coagulation, and neurologic dysfunction; Phoenix-8 is based on
those four organ systems plus endocrine, immunologic, renal, and hepatic
dysfunction. Sepsis is defined as a Phoenix Sepsis Score &geq; 2. Septic Shock
is defined as sepsis with at least one cardiovascular point.  The limits
reported in this table reflect the implementation of the criteria in software
whereas the comparable published tables report the criteria from a clinical
perspective.[@sanchezpinto_2024_development;@schlapback_2024_international] The
two presentations of the criteria are consistent in practice.
