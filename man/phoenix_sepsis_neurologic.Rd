\usage{
phoenix_sepsis_neurologic(data, fixed_pupils = fixed_pupils, gcs = gcs, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{data.frame} or \code{list}}

\item{fixed_pupils}{name, unquoted, of the column in \code{data} denoting
pupil reactivity.  Expect values of 0, 1, or \code{NA} with 1 indicating
bilaterally fixed pupils. If omitted, then \code{fixed_pupils} is used as a
default.}

\item{gcs}{name, unquoted, of the column in \code{data} denoting the gcs
total score.  Expected values are integers between 3 and 15 inclusively, with
permissable \code{NA} values.  If omitted then \code{gcs} is used as a
default.}

\item{...}{pass through}
}
\value{
an integer vector
}
\description{
Assement of neurologic disfunction based on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and
pupil reactiveity.
}
\details{
Scoring:
\tabular{ll}{
Bilaterally fixed pupil \tab 2 points \cr
Glasgow Coma Score (total) less or equal 10 \tab 1 point \cr
Reactive pupils and GCS > 10 \tab 0 point
}
Missing value will be mapped to a value of 0 as was done when developing the
Phoenix criteria.  Note that this is done on a input by input basis.  That
is, if pupil reactivity is missing but GCS (total) = 9, then the score is one
point.

GCS total is the sum of a score based on eyes, motor control, and verbal
responsiveness.

Eye response:
\enumerate{ \item no eye opening, \item eye opening to pain, \item eye
opening to sound, \item eyes open spontaneously.}

Verbal response:
\enumerate{ \item no verbal response, \item incomprehensible sounds, \item
inappropriate words, \item confused, \item orientated }

Motor response:
\enumerate{ \item no motor response, \item abnormal extension to pain, \item
abnormal flexion to pain, \item widthdrawal from pain, \item localized pain,
\item obeys commands}
