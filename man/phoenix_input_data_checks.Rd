\arguments{
\item{pao2}{numeric vector,  PaO2 is the arterial oxygen pressure measured in
mmHg}

\item{spo2}{numeric vector, SpO2 is oxygen saturation, measured in as a
percent, expected values are integer values between 0 and 100.  A warning
will be given for values between 0 and 1 along with any value outside of 0 to
100.  A warning is also given for values exceeding 97 as sf_ratio is only
valid for use in Phoenix if SpO2 is less than or equal to 97.}

\item{fio2}{numeric vector,  FiO2 is the fraction of inspired oxygen with
expected values between 0.21 (room air) to 1.00.}
